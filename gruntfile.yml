# A service consists of the following fields:
# endPoint      -- REST endpoint, e.g. /rest/service/<endPoint>
# commandLine   -- Command line to run
#                  Some special command line parameters are
#                  #value  -- replace this argument with the parameter from the POST
#                  <in     -- look for an uploaded file
#                  >out    -- the process will generate this file for later download
# description   -- description of the endpoint
# defaults      -- a hashmap of default values for "#value" parameters

    description: |
      Perform feature extraction on segmented images (DICOM Segmentation Objects, dso) given
      the original DICOM images and the dso.  Returns a directory containing many different files.

      The docker container contains the feature pipeline runner at
      /riipl/runFeaturePipeline. This program takes in 3 inputs in the
      following order:

        <directory path with a DSO> <directory path with DICOM series> <output directory path>

      The output directory should contain a boundary image and a scores csv
      file. The boundary image should show a correct segmentation of a
      tumor.
